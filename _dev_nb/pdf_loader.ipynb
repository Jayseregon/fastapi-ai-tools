      "This guideline outlines and defines the best practices and standards for the placement of new distribution\n",
      "conduit and fibre drop cable within Xplore Fibre Servicing Area (FSA) design, offering insights to\n",
      "engineers and technicians to optimize network performance, increase installation efficiencies and\n",
      "minimize maintenance efforts.\n",
      "The main characteristics of the underground drop cable and conduit architecture are:\n",
      "• Every Single Family/Business Unit (SxU) premise will have a drop conduit placed to property line.\n",
      "• A fibre drop cable will be placed to demarcation location, where Network Interface Device (NID) is\n",
      "placed, IF there is a Right-of-Entry (RoE) agreement signed prior to FSA build.\n",
      "• Drop conduit will end at a flower pot placed at property line (P/L) if there is no RoE agreement\n",
      "signed prior to FSA build.\n",
      "• Maximum drop conduit length between pull boxes is 100m (standard) and 200m in rural settings.\n",
      "• Round Drop cable is recommended in underground pulling application.\n",
      "• All permit applications should have placement of flowerpot on the drawing.\n",
      "**See Figure 1** for a typical drop placement for SxU premise.\n",

      "## 3.1 Mainway Routing\n",
      "\n",
      "Xplore’s preferred method is to place of one (1) 50mm conduit as main way at a minimum where the\n",
      "distribution cable needs to be extended within the FSA footprint. In most cases the placement of 1-50mm\n",
      "conduit will be sufficient for placement of the cable for the FSA build, for the future growth as well as\n",
      "expansion, should it be required. A second conduit of 50mm should be placed at this time if the designer\n",
      "feels that:\n",
      "• There is a chance of substantial growth in the future.\n",
      "• The route is the major route of the distribution network.\n",
      "The current cable capacities along with future and restorative capacity requirements must be considered\n",
      "when determining the size and number of conduits required through a section.\n",
      "A conduit will be considered full once 70% of its area volume has been occupied.\n",
      "Distribution cables, Transport cables, and MPT tails should be placed inside main way conduit.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2 Drop Conduit Routing\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Xplore will place drop conduit to all Single Family or Business Unit (SxU) property.\n",
      "Xplore’s preferred method is to place one (1) 18/14mm or 14/10mm conduit as drop conduit to property line\n",
      "(P/L) at the minimum. **See Figure 2** for details.\n",
      "The path from the property line to NID, usually on the side of the building, can be direct buried if possible.\n",
      "Drop paths from Service Box (SB), where Multiport Terminal (MPT) is located, to P/L or flower pot must\n",
      "remain within the public Right-of-Way or documented utility easement and must never transition from\n",
      "private property to private property.\n",
      "It is recommended to keep both side of the conduits capped until drop cable placement is completed.\n",
      "In the public right-of-way the drop conduit length should be kept to a maximum of 100m from the\n",
      "terminal location to P/L or flower pot, to keep the pulling length to a reasonable distance.\n",
      "In some instances, such as in rural settings, there may be the need to design a longer duct length due to\n",
      "location of the terminal in relation to the P/L or flower pot. We would recommend to keep this distance at\n",
      "a maximum of 200m. Should you require longer distances we recommend a pull box in between to allow\n",
      "for easier installation at time-of-service order.\n",
      "Note: Some jurisdictions may have certain parameters in place which can impact the design and build\n",
      "such as:\n",
      "• Use of existing vs. new infrastructure.\n",
      "• Above grade vs. below grade - jurisdiction preference with factors such as snow removal and\n",
      "water table nuances. A pedestal should be used instead of Service Box.\n",

      "The flower pot (FP) needs to be installed with the lid flush to ground level. This will allow for easy access\n",

      "install the flower pot in the least intrusive location for the occupants. The flower pot has an Electric Marker\n",

      "When proposing flower pot placement, the location must be as close as possible to the back of Right-of-\n",
      "Way & property line, adjacent to the other utilities. Where possible it should be placed on a joint property\n",
      "line in order to feed both premises from the same flower pot.\n",
      "In areas where the location of the flower pot at property line is not feasible on the demarcation side due to\n",
      "concrete coverage or other obstructions, it can be placed in the most strategic location which will allow a\n",
      "successful drop to be placed in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.1 Flower Pot Installation Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "• Only install flower pot for a SxU premise if a Right-of-Entry (RoE) is not signed during the time of\n",
