In most cases the placement of 1-50mm \nconduit will be sufficient for placement of the cable for the FSA build, for the future growth as well as \nexpansion, should it be required. A second conduit of 50mm should be placed at this time if the designer \nfeels that:  \n\uf0b7 \nThere is a chance of substantial growth in the future.  \n\uf0b7 \nThe route is the major route of the distribution network.  \nThe current cable capacities along with future and restorative capacity requirements must be considered \nwhen determining the size and number of conduits required through a section.  \nA conduit will be considered full once 70% of its area volume has been occupied. \nDistribution cables, Transport cables, and MPT tails should be placed inside main way conduit.  \n3.2 Drop Conduit Routing \nNote: Xplore will place drop conduit to all Single Family or Business Unit (SxU) property.  \nXplore\u2019s preferred method is to place one (1) 18/14mm or 14/10mm conduit as drop conduit to property line \n(P/L) at the minimum. See Figure 2 for details.  \nThe path from the property line to NID, usually on the side of the building, can be direct buried if possible. \nDrop paths from Service Box (SB), where Multiport Terminal (MPT) is located, to P/L or flower pot must \nremain within the public Right-of-Way or documented utility easement and must never transition from \nprivate property to private property.    \nIt is recommended to keep both side of the conduits capped until drop cable placement is completed.   \nIn the public right-of-way the drop conduit length should be kept to a maximum of 100m from the \nterminal location to P/L or flower pot, to keep the pulling length to a reasonable distance.  \nIn some instances, such as in rural settings, there may be the need to design a longer duct length due to \nlocation of the terminal in relation to the P/L or flower pot. We would recommend to keep this distance at \na maximum of 200m. Should you require longer distances we recommend a pull box in between to allow \nfor easier installation at time-of-service order. \nNote: Some jurisdictions may have certain parameters in place which can impact the design and build \nsuch as: \n\uf0b7 \nUse of existing vs. new infrastructure.  \n\uf0b7 \nAbove grade vs. below grade - jurisdiction preference with factors such as snow removal and \nwater table nuances. A pedestal should be used instead of Service Box. \n\n\n\n\n![**Summary:** Logo of Xplore, featuring a stylized \"X\" and the brand name.\n\n**Text Extraction:**  \nXplore](#)",

This will allow for easy access \nto the drop for future installation to the building. Whether it is temporary or permanent in nature, try to \ninstall the flower pot in the least intrusive location for the occupants. The flower pot has an Electric Marker \n(EM) equipped locatable lid. \nWhen proposing flower pot placement, the location must be as close as possible to the back of Right-of-\nWay & property line, adjacent to the other utilities. Where possible it should be placed on a joint property \nline in order to feed both premises from the same flower pot. \nIn areas where the location of the flower pot at property line is not feasible on the demarcation side due to \nconcrete coverage or other obstructions, it can be placed in the most strategic location which will allow a \nsuccessful drop to be placed in the future.  \n4.1 Flower Pot Installation Criteria  \n\uf0b7 \nOnly install flower pot for a SxU premise if a Right-of-Entry (RoE) is not signed during the time of \nFSA construction. In this scenario, the drop conduit ends in a flower pot is required.  \nFigure 2 shows the proper design and placement of main way conduit, drop conduit, and flower pot.  \n \nFigure 2: Mainway & Drop Conduit and Flower Pot Placement \n5 Demarcation Location \nXplore\u2019s demarcation location should be in the vicinity of the existing electrical meter and Telco / CATV \nNetwork Interface Device (NID).  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n![Xplore logo featuring the brand name \"Xplore\" in stylized font with a graphic element resembling an \"X.\"\n\nXplore\u00ae](#)\n![Mainway and Drop Conduit diagram illustrating connections and specifications for conduits, including Flower Pot placement, Service Box, and diameters of conduits.\n\nMainway & Drop Conduit  \nNO RoE  \nL/L  \nFlower Pot  \nP/L  \nNO RoE  \nROE  \nDrop Conduit (18/14mm)  \nL/L  \nP/L  \nNO RoE  \nService Box  \nMainway Conduit (50mm)  \nFlower Pot is placed on the demarcation side](#)",
