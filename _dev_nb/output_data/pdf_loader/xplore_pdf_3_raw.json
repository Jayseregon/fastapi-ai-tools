Individual performance \nwill also be considered but preference will be given to components that integrates best to the overall \nnetwork. \nIndividual product will be evaluated based on following metrics:  \n1. Technical Speciation  \n \n\u2013 Packaging, Environment, Performance Standards \n2. Systems Engineering   \n\u2013 How the product interacts with other components \n3. Craftsmanship   \n \n\u2013 Field installation, deployment, and maintenance  \n4. Pricing   \n \n \n\u2013 Cost per unit \n5.

SC, abbreviated for Subscriber Connector, has also been referred to as Square Connector or \nStandard Connector. It\u2019s a popular fiber-optic connector due to its low-cost, durability and simple \ninstallation for both point-to-point and passive optical networking. \nSC is a push-pull device that uses a ceramic ferrule to deliver highly accurate alignment in a fiber-optic \nlink. It\u2019s a square-shaped connector\u2014also known as \u201cstick and click\u201d for its SC acronym\u2014that comes with \na locking tab that enables the push-on and pull-off operation \n3.3.1. Corning NPC+ \nOverview:  \nThe NPC+ (No Polish Connector) eliminates field polishing, loose parts, and termination tools. The \ninnovative buffer clamp design eliminates rework by delivering superior twist and transmission with \napplied load (TWAL) mechanical performance. After fiber preparation and cleaving, installation is a simple \nthree-step process: insert fiber, actuate splice, activate the buffer clamp.

All primary fiber types are supported, and each connector is color coded per \nindustry-standard requirements to aide in identification during and after installation. A factory-installed \nwedge clip (included with each connector) is removed and discarded upon completion of the termination. \nIncorporated into this device is an innovative, translucent wedge enabling the use of a common VFI to \nprovide a \u201cpass/fail\u201d signal once physical contact is achieved. \n\n\n\n\n![Concise Summary: Logo of \"Xplore\" featuring a stylized \"X.\"\n\nExtracted Text: Xplore\u00ae X](#)\n![Concise summary: A 3D model of a connector, featuring a white top casing and a green bottom component.\n\nExtracted text: None](#)\n\n\n\n|Metric|Rating|Remark|\n|---|---|---|\n|Technical Specifications|A||\n|System Engineering|C|Loose fit|\n|Craftsmanship|A||",

The FOSC-450 features a single wrap-around gel seal with four or six cable ports. The single seal \nslides easily into the closure\u2019s base for rapid, secure installation.

Now, it also includes new models and configurations for \nmore flexibility to meet the complex needs of today\u2019s fiber optic networks.  \nFibre Dome Closures utilizes the external cable assembly module (ECAM) built-in cable entry port \nsystem, which allows true plug-and-play capability. This reduces installation and labor costs because the \ncable preparation and installation are completed outside of the closure body \u2014 allowing the tech to add/ \nremove cables from the closure without breaking the cable seals of previously installed cables.  \nCorning Fibre Dome Closure intended to meet the needs of anyone using fiber optic splice closures in the \nlong haul, metro, local access (xDSL, HFC, wireless backhaul), and FTTx feeder/distribution networks. It \nis designed for butt, single, or ribbon fiber applications. It is tested to Telcordia\u2019s GR-771-CORE Generic \nRequirements for fiber optic splice closures. It requires no special tools, which reduces tooling costs and \nallows for ease of installation and re-entry into the closure.  \n\n\n\n\n![Xplore logo featuring stylized \"X\" design and the brand name \"Xplore\u00ae\". \n\nXplore\u00ae](#)\n![**Image Summary:**  \nImage of telecommunications equipment featuring a vertical cylindrical antenna and a rectangular base with a circuit board. \n\n**Extracted Text:**  \nNo text present in the image.](#)\n\n\n\n|Metric|Rating|Remark|\n|---|---|---|\n|Technical Specifications|A||\n|System Engineering|A||\n|Craftsmanship|A||",

The FOSC excels in underground/vault, pedestal, and aerial applications to deliver \nhigh-speed fiber communication in any outside plant application. It can be used in straight or branch \napplications with a capacity of up to 144F splices. Green Hornet is ideal in FTTH applications where up to \ntwelve (12) drops can be deployed. The oval main cable seal enables mid-sheath cable splices where uncut \nfibers are stored and expressed through the closure. Green Hornet can be deployed with an integrated 16-\nport adapter bulkhead in SC or LC footprints. Channell\u2019s grommet technology provides easy cable \ninstallation, robust sealing, and cable strain relief retention. The grommets are designed to seal all types of \nincoming and drop cables in various diameters, constructions, and sizes. The splice closure may be ordered \npackaged with a pedestal or grade level vault delivering the best overall value in a complete package.  \nFEATURES:  \n- \nEnvironmentally Sealed: Air Water Tight  \n- \nCraft-Friendly Design  \n- \nQuick and Tool-less Installation  \n- \nRe-enterable and Re-useable  \nTESTING SPECIFICATIONS:  \n- \nMeets GR771, IP68, and IEC 61300 test standards \n \nFigure 18: Channell Green Hornet Enclsore (G5N is shown) \nMetric \nRating \nRemark \nTechnical Specifications \nA \nSmall dimension  \nSystem Engineering \nA \n \n \nCraftsmanship \nA \nSimple to open/close \n\n\n\n\n![Xplore logo featuring the text \"Xplore\u00ae\" and a stylized \"X\" design.\n\nXplore\u00ae](#)\n![**Summary:** Image features two components: a cylindrical black object on the left and a complex electronic assembly on the right, potentially indicating equipment or machinery parts.\n\n**Text extracted:** \nNo text found in the image.](#)\n\n\n\n|Metric|Rating|Remark|\n|---|---|---|\n|Technical Specifications|A|Small dimension|\n|System Engineering|A||\n|Craftsmanship|A|Simple to open/close|",

This \nmethod works well in the rural application where long tail MPT design does not make sense. These \nterminals act as a splice case and terminal all in one unit. Feeder and distribution counts can be placed in \nthe same fibre cable sheath with additional options to add extra ports if ever required. \nAlthough there are 8 & 12 port options available, try avoid using them and stay to 6 port or less option if \nall possible. he reason being is that you can only fit 6 ports per end with the ports facing the pole, so I&R \ncan easily plug in the fibre drop. If the ports are placed on the far end, it is 24\u201d further away and won\u2019t be \nreachable from the pole.

The standard cables \nto be used as a first choice for the majority of Xplore fibre network application are  \n- \nDielectric & single-jacket fibre optic cable \n- \nDielectric & double-jacket/double-armour for gopher / rodent infested area as the outer shield is \nsacrificial to the gnawing of the gopher \n- \nAll dielectric cables or Poly / Single Jacket used in areas which prevent the use of a cable with a \nmetallic shield such as areas of Power Influence \nAdvantage of going with dielectric cable is due to lighter weight so it is easier to withstand wind storm \nimpact in Maritime provinces. Single Jacket cable without metallic armor does not require permit and \nmeet hydro regulation in some territory / municipality. (No Pole-Line-Analysis \u201cPLA\u201d is required in \nMaritime provinces at the time of writing)   \nThe specification would be Xplore fibre network standards and guidelines unless the type of cable is \ndictated by the utility or regulatory requirement.  \nManufacturers  \n- \nCorning SMF-28e+  \n- \nAFL \u2013 LE Series / LN Series (Rodent Resistant) \n- \nCommscope \u2013 D-LN Series  \n \nOverall Rating:  \nCorning cable would be the standard choice of outdoor fibre optic cable, especially for critical run/path.
