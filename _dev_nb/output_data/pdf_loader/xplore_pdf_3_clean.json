Evaluation Metrics\nEvaluation will focus on connectivity, adaptability, easiness of installation, maintenance, and field\napplication to other OSP components of Xplore fibre network as a whole system. Individual performance\nwill also be considered but preference will be given to components that integrates best to the overall\nnetwork.\nIndividual product will be evaluated based on following metrics:\n1. Technical Speciation\n\n\u2013 Packaging, Environment, Performance Standards\n2. Systems Engineering\n\u2013 How the product interacts with other components\n3. Craftsmanship\n\n\u2013 Field installation, deployment, and maintenance\n4. Pricing\n\n\u2013 Cost per unit\n5. Lead Time and Distribution\n\u2013 Time to order and deliver material to warehouse/site\n6. Customer Care\n\n\u2013 Post-sale customer/client support service\n2. Evaluation Ratings\nA letter grade rating will be assigned to each metrics listed in Section 1. A breakdown of rating is listed as\nfollow:\nLetter Grade Rating\nDescription\nA \u2013 Excellent\n-\nNo issue to report\n-\nExceed expectation\n-\nNo further test is required\nB \u2013 Very Good\n\n-\n1 \u2013 2 issues to report\n-\nNo further test is required\nC \u2013 Good\n\n-\n2 \u2013 4 issues to report\n-\nField trial is highly recommended\nD \u2013 Fair\n\n-\nMajor issue(s) to report\n-\nFurther study and review is required\n-\nField trial is mandatory before deployment\n\nNote: The rating is assigned to each metric centric to field application on Xplore fibre network. Issues\nreported do not necessary reflect issue with the product itself but instead associates with field application\nduring Xplore fibre network build and operation.\n3. OSP Product Evaluation and Rating\nOnly Evaluation Metric 1-3 are rated in this document as 4-6 are beyond the scope of the evaluation at\nthis moment. Rating for metric 4-6 will be assigned once more information is given in future date.\nAn overall rating will be assigned at the end of each product section which indicates if the product is the\npreferred product of its category \u2013 Standard Choice, or \u201cNumber 2\u201d choice as acceptable direct\nreplacement \u2013 Acceptable Alternate Choice, or simply avoid using the product \u2013 Not Standard Choice.\nNOTE: Skip to Section 4 for OSP Product Standardization Summary\n\n[IMAGE: Xplore logo featuring a stylized \"X\" component with the word \"Xplore\" in a modern font.

The\nfield end is mechanically connected, to be spliced to mechanical connector in the field. The reason to avoid\npre-connectorized drop cable (field end) is to have the flexibility to have custom drop length tailored for\neach application without the need of storing slacks on MPT end or on customer\u2019s demarcation point.\nRound drop cables are preferred for underground application for the easiness to pull cable in and out of\nunderground infrastructure which usually has less room to work with the bend radius. Flat drop cables are\npreferred for aerial application due to fitness to wedge clamp on pole.

SC, abbreviated for Subscriber Connector, has also been referred to as Square Connector or\nStandard Connector. It\u2019s a popular fiber-optic connector due to its low-cost, durability and simple\ninstallation for both point-to-point and passive optical networking.\nSC is a push-pull device that uses a ceramic ferrule to deliver highly accurate alignment in a fiber-optic\nlink. It\u2019s a square-shaped connector\u2014also known as \u201cstick and click\u201d for its SC acronym\u2014that comes with\na locking tab that enables the push-on and pull-off operation\n3.3.1. Corning NPC+\nOverview:\nThe NPC+ (No Polish Connector) eliminates field polishing, loose parts, and termination tools. The\ninnovative buffer clamp design eliminates rework by delivering superior twist and transmission with\napplied load (TWAL) mechanical performance. After fiber preparation and cleaving, installation is a simple\nthree-step process: insert fiber, actuate splice, activate the buffer clamp. Faster than fusion splicing, the\nNPC+ delivers savings in installation expense and reduces overall complexity of termination\n\n**Figure 12: Corning NPC+ SC Connector**\n\nMetric\nRating\nRemark\nTechnical Specifications\nA\n\nSystem Engineering\nA\nFlexible \u2013 OptiTap connector available\nCraftsmanship\nA\n\nPros:\n-\nCorning mechanical connector has longer channel that fits into connection tightly\nCons:\n-\nNone\nOverall Rating:\nNumber 1: Standard choice\n\n[IMAGE: Xplore logo featuring the word \"Xplore\" in a modern typeface with a stylized letter \"X\".

All primary fiber types are supported, and each connector is color coded per\nindustry-standard requirements to aide in identification during and after installation. A factory-installed\nwedge clip (included with each connector) is removed and discarded upon completion of the termination.\nIncorporated into this device is an innovative, translucent wedge enabling the use of a common VFI to\nprovide a \u201cpass/fail\u201d signal once physical contact is achieved.\n\n[IMAGE: Concise Summary: Logo of \"Xplore\" featuring a stylized \"X.\" Extracted Text: Xplore\u00ae X]\n[IMAGE: Concise summary: A 3D model of a connector, featuring a white top casing and a green bottom component.

The FOSC excels in underground/vault, pedestal, and aerial applications to deliver\nhigh-speed fiber communication in any outside plant application. It can be used in straight or branch\napplications with a capacity of up to 144F splices. Green Hornet is ideal in FTTH applications where up to\ntwelve (12) drops can be deployed. The oval main cable seal enables mid-sheath cable splices where uncut\nfibers are stored and expressed through the closure. Green Hornet can be deployed with an integrated 16-\nport adapter bulkhead in SC or LC footprints. Channell\u2019s grommet technology provides easy cable\ninstallation, robust sealing, and cable strain relief retention. The grommets are designed to seal all types of\nincoming and drop cables in various diameters, constructions, and sizes.

This\nmethod works well in the rural application where long tail MPT design does not make sense. These\nterminals act as a splice case and terminal all in one unit. Feeder and distribution counts can be placed in\nthe same fibre cable sheath with additional options to add extra ports if ever required.\nAlthough there are 8 & 12 port options available, try avoid using them and stay to 6 port or less option if\nall possible. he reason being is that you can only fit 6 ports per end with the ports facing the pole, so I&R\ncan easily plug in the fibre drop. If the ports are placed on the far end, it is 24\u201d further away and won\u2019t be\nreachable from the pole.
