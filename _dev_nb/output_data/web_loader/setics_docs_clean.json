Rules Specific to Naming Network Nodes\n\nIn a service network, the nodes are placed in a tree structure with a logical relationship of parent-child, like for example in a FTTH architecture in which a FCP is logically connected to a CO (see in particular Appendix 1: Setics Sttar Data Model for more details).\nThe assignment of unique identifiers to network nodes reflects this property by making sure to create each node identifier by concatenating the identifier of its parent node with the identifier of the node concerned.\n*Example\nWith the default naming given by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t.\n- CO identified by \u201cN001\u201d.\n- FCP identified by \u201cN001.02\u201d where \u201cN001\u201d is the identifier of the parent CO and \u201c.02\u201d is the identifier of the FCP within the service area of the parent CO.\nIn addition, in order to allow the import and reuse in a new project (or in a new iteration of an existing project) of identifiers already assigned to the nodes of the network, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will ignore the possible repetitions of identifiers.\n*Example\nIn Project 1, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t created a CO (Level 1) with the identifier \u201cN001\u201d and an FCP (Level 2) with the identifier \u201cN001.02\u201d.\nIn Project 2:\n- The previous CO and FCP layers are re-imported as input data at their respective levels, with the ELEMENTID attribute containing the identifiers previously assigned by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t as external identifier;\n- The node naming format is defined as {external-id } for Level 1 (CO) nodes as well as for Level 2 (FCP) nodes.\nIn Project 2, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will reuse the imposed COs and FCPs and retain their identifiers:\n- It will not create an identifier \u201cN001N001.02\u201d for the FCP as it would impose the concatenation of the identifier of the parent node with the node concerned (here the FCP \u201cN001.02\u201d with its parent the CO \u201cN001\u201d);\n- It will name the CO \u201cN001\u201d and the FCP \u201cN001.02\u201d based on intuition, without compromising the rule to bring up the hierarchy of nodes in their naming.",

    "page_content": "#### 5.6.5.4. Placement\n\nWith Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t you can import nodes, but you can also ask the software to place nodes automatically.\nTo do this, you must Add Node Support in the Passive Architecture tab, then click on the Open Properties\u2026 button\nComplete the tabs: Data, Costs, Equipment, and Topology of the Properties menu (see details in section Node Properties).\nThen, complete the Placement tab:\nArchitecture tab - Node - Support properties - Placement\n\nCommand or setting\nDescription\n\n Algorithm\n Choice of algorithm type: Before routing, After routing\nThe pre-routing algorithm places the forward nodes before defining the network route. Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t creates the network graph, then places the nodes on this graph, prioritizing the infrastructures that seem most relevant at that time. The route is then calculated, specifically based on the location of the nodes thus positioned.\nThe nodes created by this algorithm are always centered in their service area.\nThe inherent limitation of this algorithm is that the positioning of the nodes is done before the routing is defined, in some cases causing an overlapping of service areas or some nodes may be placed on none optimal infrastructure.\nThe \u201cAfter Routing\u201d algorithm performs node placement after routing. In this case the routing between the existing nodes and the endpoints is defined first. Then the algorithm follows this routing, beginning from the endpoint, to create areas according to the placement parameter: number of terminations to be connected min and max, the maximum distance between the node and an endpoint as well as the maximum number of infrastructure junction between the node and the nearest distribution infrastructure. As soon as one of these conditions is reached the node is created.\nThe nodes positioned by this algorithm can be centered or located upstream of their service area.\n\n Size parameters\n The size parameters are the minimum and maximum number of terminations to be assigned for each node, as well as the \u201cTarget\u201d number, i.e., the ideal number of terminations that you want to assign for each node. If the maximum is not set, the minimum is taken into consideration as \u201cTarget\u201d.\nThe maximum parameter is always respected while the minimum can be violated if this rule is in conflict with the distance parameter.\nThe pre-routing algorithm will try to create a maximum of area near the targeted size.\nThe \u201cAfter Routing\u201d algorithm considers the target as a local maximum, it will then promote the creation of areas which are of the targeted size or faintly smaller as well as the maximum size and the one smaller, but it will disfavour the areas of a size faintly larger than the target. For instance with a targeted size of 3 and a maximum size of 6, the algorithm will preferentially create areas of 3 and 6 termination, then areas of 2 and 5 terminations to create some of 1 and 4 only in last resort.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Max distance by infrastructure\n Maximum distance between the node and the endpoints in meters : The node will be placed so that the distance between it and all the endpoints it serves always stays under this value.\nThis criterion has priority over the number of terminations criterion and will always be respected if possible: Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will therefore sometimes create a node serving less than the minimum number of terminations when the maximum distance would otherwise be exceeded.\nNull values are not taken into consideration. In this case, the corresponding criterion is inactive.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Max number of sections\n Maximum number of non-null pathway sections between the node and any downstream node or endpoint. The node will be placed when this number is reached at one point in the network.\nAs for the maximum distance this criterion has priority over the number of terminations criterion: Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will therefore sometimes create a node with serving less than the minimum number of terminations when the maximum number of sections would otherwise be exceeded.\nNull values are not taken into consideration. In this case, the corresponding criterion is inactive.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Place nodes before infrastructure\n Option to select the infrastructure/s to create additional nodes. The nodes will be created upstream of the interconnection of the selected infrastructure/s. If there are several infrastructures selected there are no nodes created between the selected infrastructures. This additional nodes for example can later be used to deploy further drops.\n\n Node positioning\n This criterion allow you to choose if the node should be at the center of his service area or try to be nearer from his parent node.\nIf centered is chosen, the algorithm will center the node in it service area according to the number of terminations and it direct downstream node.\n\n Extend service areas upstream\n When this option is checked, STTAR tries to fill up incomplete nodes (that are not at full capacity) with upstream elements within the maximum distance to extend the service area.\n\n Mandatory before an upstream node\n Option to force the software to position a node of this level before an upstream node. Any endpoint will then be connected to this type of node.\nFor example, if it makes the presence of a pooling point before the optical connection node mandatory, the latter will not have a direct area. Otherwise, it will be possible to have endpoints served directly by the optical connection node without going through a pooling point.\n\n Can collocate with site if there are more than \u2026 terminations.\n Specification of a number of terminations from which the software authorizes a node to be in a shared dwelling.\nIf the value of this criterion is not null, it authorizes the presence of a node and an endpoint with the same geographic coordinates if the endpoint has the required number of terminations.\nFor example, an optical drop point (PBO) may be collocated with an endpoint, in the case of a building, it will be in its riser.\nIf \u201cMandatory\u201d option is checked, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will automatically create a node collocated as soon as an endpoint has the number of terminations awaited.\n\n Manage Exception\n The size and distance parameters dispose of a tool to manage exception.\nArchitecture tab - Node - Manage Exception\nThis window allows the management of exception on some infrastructures. For instance to impose a shorter distance between the node and endpoints while using an aerial infrastructure.\nThe link Add allow to add a new infrastructure and the link Delete Selection allow to remove the exceptions on an infrastructure in this table.\nSee section below for more details.\n\nNotes on the exception rules :\nWhen exception rules are set up the rule taken into account at each point is the one of the current infrastructure relatively to the downstream path. This means that, in the case of the number of sections parameter, it is possible that a path containing some infrastructure with an exception contains more total sections than the max value of the exception if the node is locating on a different infrastructure allowing this value, nevertheless the number of sections of the infrastructure with the exception setting will be less or equal to this max.\nFor example : If the default number of sections is 6 but the exception for the second infrastructure (red) is 3 then in the below situation the node will be located so that the path will contain 6 sections including 3 of the red infrastructure (including the adduction).\nExample 1 : Blue infrastructure set at 6 sections and red infrastructure at 3 sections\nIn the other hand, if the infrastructure with the lower allowed value is the more upstream, the node will be placed according to this value regardless of what the downstream value was.\nIn the previous example if the default value is 3 and the exception is 6 then the node will be placed as soon as we reach the blue infrastructure with already 3 sections downstream.\nExample 2 : Blue infrastructure set at 3 sections and red infrastructure at 6 sections\nThis is also true for the distance and capacity settings.\n*It is important to note that the user can either import nodes (see details in section Import Nodes) and in this case, they must not complete the Placement part of Node Properties, or ask the software to automatically place the nodes by filling in the Node Properties part (see details in section Node Properties).\n!In the event that the user imports nodes and completes the Placement part of Node Properties, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will only take into account the imported data and will not automatically place the nodes.",

Glossary\n\nThe glossary lists all technical vocabulary used in the software Setics Sttar:\n\nName\nDescription\n\nAccess Network\n The access network, which goes from a unique upstream node (usually called point of presence or central office) to endpoints, consists in a feeder network and a distribution network.\nThe term \u00ab local loop \u00bb is also used.\n\nCO\n Central office.\nThis is usually the topmost node in the access network. This location gathers all lines serving the customers in a given area.\n\nConnections of links, nodes, endpoints\n Pathways created by Setics Sttar to connect two infrastructures. For example, a pathway to connect a duct to an aerial support.\n\nDistribution Network\n Downstream part of the network.\nThis part of the network usually goes from the feeder network (the fibre concentration point) to the endpoints.\n\nEndpoint\n Building, house, or any physical point that will be connected to an end of the network.\n\nFCP\n Fibre concentration point.\nUsually the top-level node in the distribution part of the access network.\n\nFDT\n Fibre distribution terminal.\nUsually the lower-level node in the distribution part of the access network. Subscribers are directly connected to the FDT.\n\nFeeder Network\n Upstream part of the network\nThis network is usually defined as the part of the network between the POP (point of presence) and the FCP (fibre concentration point).\n\nGIS\n Geographical information system.\n\nGPON\n Gigabit passive optical network: A technical standard (ITU G.984) for fibre access networks.\n\nNetwork level\n Network levels are defined as all elements of a network located between an upstream node and a logically connected downstream node.\nIt is possible to define level-specific engineering rules.\n\nNode\n Point of presence \u2013 active or passive \u2013 of the operator playing a functional role in the network.\nNetwork nodes are hierarchically ordered, thus defining network levels.\n\nP2MP\n Point-to-multipoint. For example, the architecture defined by the GPON standard.\n\nP2P\n Point-to-point\n\nPathway\n Infrastructure segment having one or several cables going through.\n\nPolyline\n Type of geographical data used in GIS.\nA polyline is a collection of successive line segments.\n\nPOP\n Point of presence.\nSimilar to a central office (see \u201cCO\u201d).\n\nPremise\n Termination of the network.\nEngineering parameters allow to specify a specific number of fibres for a premise.\n\nSupport\n A Setics Sttar container containing infrastructure elements representing pathways, nodes or endpoints, as well as the connections between them.",

Consequently, users must provide a positive reference cost to each and every element of the project. The reference currency unit is parameterizable and defined for the whole project.\nEvery type of infrastructure has to have a fixed and/or linear cost. Similarly, the creation of a node has a cost. This may be the cost of construction, or even the net present value of the cost induced by renting the building over several years or decades. The actual meaning of the cost is up to you.\nSetics Sttar Advanced Designer\t designs a network optimizing the cost of infrastructures, which generally make up the largest part of the network costs. Consequently, costs should be defined as closely as possible to reality so that their values are taken into account in a realistic way and the best possible route is chosen.\n*For the optimization algorithms to work as expected, it is strongly discouraged to use zero or near zero values, especially for the infrastructure costs.",

Similarly, a discontinuity (between two sections of infrastructure) of a length shorter than the value of the resolution will also be considered as non-existent.\n\n Data Attributes\n Optional attributes, these fields are exported in the results layers of the Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t.\nThe Name allows you to name the object of the selected GIS layer. It is used in particular during the configuration of the respect of the service areas.\nThe external identifier is the unique external key of an object of the source GIS layer, this identifier must be unique. It is usually used to make a connection between the source data and the data produced by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t.\nThe length represents the length of each segment or the geometric length of the lines of the infrastructure layer to be imported (it will be automatically put in the field).\nThe cost represents the cost of each segment or the calculated cost of the lines of the infrastructure layer to be imported (it will be automatically put in the field).\nThe served area allows you to implement the respect of the service areas. The selected field for a node/endpoint must contain the NAME of an upstream node.\nEx: this field for the endpoint layer could contain the NAMES (as configured using the NAME field) of a CO, FCP, FDT\u2026 type node.

    "page_content": "#### 5.6.5.4. Placement\n\nWith Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t you can import nodes, but you can also ask the software to place nodes automatically.\nTo do this, you must Add Node Support in the Passive Architecture tab, then click on the Open Properties\u2026 button\nComplete the tabs: Data, Costs, Equipment, and Topology of the Properties menu (see details in section Node Properties).\nThen, complete the Placement tab:\nArchitecture tab - Node - Support properties - Placement\n\nCommand or setting\nDescription\n\n Algorithm\n Choice of algorithm type: Before routing, After routing\nThe pre-routing algorithm places the forward nodes before defining the network route. Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t creates the network graph, then places the nodes on this graph, prioritizing the infrastructures that seem most relevant at that time. The route is then calculated, specifically based on the location of the nodes thus positioned.\nThe nodes created by this algorithm are always centered in their service area.\nThe inherent limitation of this algorithm is that the positioning of the nodes is done before the routing is defined, in some cases causing an overlapping of service areas or some nodes may be placed on none optimal infrastructure.\nThe \u201cAfter Routing\u201d algorithm performs node placement after routing. In this case the routing between the existing nodes and the endpoints is defined first. Then the algorithm follows this routing, beginning from the endpoint, to create areas according to the placement parameter: number of terminations to be connected min and max, the maximum distance between the node and an endpoint as well as the maximum number of infrastructure junction between the node and the nearest distribution infrastructure. As soon as one of these conditions is reached the node is created.\nThe nodes positioned by this algorithm can be centered or located upstream of their service area.\n\n Size parameters\n The size parameters are the minimum and maximum number of terminations to be assigned for each node, as well as the \u201cTarget\u201d number, i.e., the ideal number of terminations that you want to assign for each node. If the maximum is not set, the minimum is taken into consideration as \u201cTarget\u201d.\nThe maximum parameter is always respected while the minimum can be violated if this rule is in conflict with the distance parameter.\nThe pre-routing algorithm will try to create a maximum of area near the targeted size.\nThe \u201cAfter Routing\u201d algorithm considers the target as a local maximum, it will then promote the creation of areas which are of the targeted size or faintly smaller as well as the maximum size and the one smaller, but it will disfavour the areas of a size faintly larger than the target. For instance with a targeted size of 3 and a maximum size of 6, the algorithm will preferentially create areas of 3 and 6 termination, then areas of 2 and 5 terminations to create some of 1 and 4 only in last resort.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Max distance by infrastructure\n Maximum distance between the node and the endpoints in meters : The node will be placed so that the distance between it and all the endpoints it serves always stays under this value.\nThis criterion has priority over the number of terminations criterion and will always be respected if possible: Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will therefore sometimes create a node serving less than the minimum number of terminations when the maximum distance would otherwise be exceeded.\nNull values are not taken into consideration. In this case, the corresponding criterion is inactive.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Max number of sections\n Maximum number of non-null pathway sections between the node and any downstream node or endpoint. The node will be placed when this number is reached at one point in the network.\nAs for the maximum distance this criterion has priority over the number of terminations criterion: Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will therefore sometimes create a node with serving less than the minimum number of terminations when the maximum number of sections would otherwise be exceeded.\nNull values are not taken into consideration. In this case, the corresponding criterion is inactive.\nSee more details about exceptions in the section below this table.\n\n Place nodes before infrastructure\n Option to select the infrastructure/s to create additional nodes. The nodes will be created upstream of the interconnection of the selected infrastructure/s. If there are several infrastructures selected there are no nodes created between the selected infrastructures. This additional nodes for example can later be used to deploy further drops.\n\n Node positioning\n This criterion allow you to choose if the node should be at the center of his service area or try to be nearer from his parent node.\nIf centered is chosen, the algorithm will center the node in it service area according to the number of terminations and it direct downstream node.\n\n Extend service areas upstream\n When this option is checked, STTAR tries to fill up incomplete nodes (that are not at full capacity) with upstream elements within the maximum distance to extend the service area.\n\n Mandatory before an upstream node\n Option to force the software to position a node of this level before an upstream node. Any endpoint will then be connected to this type of node.\nFor example, if it makes the presence of a pooling point before the optical connection node mandatory, the latter will not have a direct area. Otherwise, it will be possible to have endpoints served directly by the optical connection node without going through a pooling point.\n\n Can collocate with site if there are more than \u2026 terminations.\n Specification of a number of terminations from which the software authorizes a node to be in a shared dwelling.\nIf the value of this criterion is not null, it authorizes the presence of a node and an endpoint with the same geographic coordinates if the endpoint has the required number of terminations.\nFor example, an optical drop point (PBO) may be collocated with an endpoint, in the case of a building, it will be in its riser.\nIf \u201cMandatory\u201d option is checked, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will automatically create a node collocated as soon as an endpoint has the number of terminations awaited.\n\n Manage Exception\n The size and distance parameters dispose of a tool to manage exception.\nArchitecture tab - Node - Manage Exception\nThis window allows the management of exception on some infrastructures. For instance to impose a shorter distance between the node and endpoints while using an aerial infrastructure.\nThe link Add allow to add a new infrastructure and the link Delete Selection allow to remove the exceptions on an infrastructure in this table.\nSee section below for more details.\n\nNotes on the exception rules :\nWhen exception rules are set up the rule taken into account at each point is the one of the current infrastructure relatively to the downstream path. This means that, in the case of the number of sections parameter, it is possible that a path containing some infrastructure with an exception contains more total sections than the max value of the exception if the node is locating on a different infrastructure allowing this value, nevertheless the number of sections of the infrastructure with the exception setting will be less or equal to this max.\nFor example : If the default number of sections is 6 but the exception for the second infrastructure (red) is 3 then in the below situation the node will be located so that the path will contain 6 sections including 3 of the red infrastructure (including the adduction).\nExample 1 : Blue infrastructure set at 6 sections and red infrastructure at 3 sections\nIn the other hand, if the infrastructure with the lower allowed value is the more upstream, the node will be placed according to this value regardless of what the downstream value was.\nIn the previous example if the default value is 3 and the exception is 6 then the node will be placed as soon as we reach the blue infrastructure with already 3 sections downstream.\nExample 2 : Blue infrastructure set at 3 sections and red infrastructure at 6 sections\nThis is also true for the distance and capacity settings.\n*It is important to note that the user can either import nodes (see details in section Import Nodes) and in this case, they must not complete the Placement part of Node Properties, or ask the software to automatically place the nodes by filling in the Node Properties part (see details in section Node Properties).\n!In the event that the user imports nodes and completes the Placement part of Node Properties, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will only take into account the imported data and will not automatically place the nodes.",

It is used in particular during the configuration of the respect of the service areas.\nThe external identifier is the unique external key of an object of the source GIS layer, this identifier must be unique. It is usually used to make a connection between the source data and the data produced by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t.\nThe parent node allows you to implement the respect of the service areas. The selected field for a node/endpoint must contain the NAME of an upstream node.\nEx: this field for the endpoint layer could contain the NAMES (as configured using the NAME field) of a CO, FCP, FDT\u2026 type node. In this case, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will connect each endpoint containing this information to the node with the specified name.\nWarning: if there are no nodes that match the name, an error message is sent to the user and the design may not work.\nFor the active Application, the following fields are also added: Usable Fibers, Spare Fibers, Max Link Budget and Max Split Ratio.\nThe fields Usable Fibers and Spare Fibers impose the need of fibers for the dimensioning of the node.\nThe fields Max Link Budget and Max Split Ratio impose restrictions on the link budget and the split ratio of the optical roads which reach this node.\nMore information regarding the Dimensioning is available at Dimensioning\n\n Preprocessing\n Preprocessing are operations performed in the specified order on the data read in the data source before being imported into the Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t data model.\nAvailable preprocessing is described in Appendix 4: Configuration of the filters and preprocessing of the input data (see details in section Setting of Filters and Preprocessing of Input Data).",

Cable Branching Techniques\n\nBranching techniques are design instructions helping the user describe better what needs to be done with the cabling.\nThis design instructions are persistent between runs of the automations and will be applied to further designs. In case of changes in the network design the algorithm tries to respect the design instructions previously made by the user but would ignore them if they are obsolete.\nChange the branching methods is available on the map by selecting the splice closure layer and \u201cChange Branching Technique\u201d.\nThere are three major types for the branching technique:\n\nFork (no splice closure):\nIn the example are two cables, starting from the cabinet and go in different directions. There are no splice closures at the intersections.\n\nExample of \"Fork\" Branching technique\n\nJoin:\nThe join method is typically used when the length of a cable has been reached. Further added cables can then cover the length.\nIn the example below cable 1 (24F) comes from the cabinet and ends in the splice closure. Cable 2 and Cable 3, each with 6 fibers go in different directions at this point.\n\nExample of \"Join\" Branching technique\n\nMidspan join:\nThe midspan join method is used when only a part of the cable goes in a different direction.\nIn the example cable 1 (24F) comes from the cabinet and is cut in the splice closure. One part joins the cable 2 (6F) to follow a different direction. The rest of cable 1 is left untouched and continues to follow its direction.\n\nExample of \"Midspan Join\" Branching technique\nTwo special cases:\n\nForking Node:\nThe forking node method is only available in some special conditions on the nodes, e.g. when several parallel cables are arriving on the nodes location.\nIn the example a join method is shown on the left. On the right a forking on the node was done so that cable 2 starts from the node while the others remain the same.\n\nExample of \"Forking Node\" Branching technique\n\nForking Midspan Node:\nThe forking midspan node method is only available in some special conditions on the nodes, e.g. when several parallel cables are arriving on the nodes location.\nIn the example a midspan is done on the node while the other cables are forked.\n\nExample of \"Forking Midspan Node\" Branching technique",

The selected field for a node/endpoint must contain the NAME of an upstream node.\nEx: this field for the endpoint layer could contain the NAMES (as configured using the NAME field) of a CO, FCP, FDT\u2026 type node. In this case, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will connect each endpoint containing this information to the node with the specified name.\nWarning: if there are no nodes that match the name, an error message is sent to the user and the design may not work.\nFor the active Application, the following fields are also added: Usable Fibers, Spare Fibers, Max Link Budget and Max Split Ratio.\nThe fields Usable Fibers and Spare Fibers impose the need of fibers for the dimensioning of the node.\nThe fields Max Link Budget and Max Split Ratio impose restrictions on the link budget and the split ratio of the optical roads which reach this node.\nMore information regarding the Dimensioning is available at Dimensioning\n\n Preprocessing\n Preprocessing are operations performed in the specified order on the data read in the data source before being imported into the Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t data model.\nAvailable preprocessing is described in Appendix 4: Configuration of the filters and preprocessing of the input data (see details in section Setting of Filters and Preprocessing of Input Data).",

Rules Specific to Naming Network Nodes\n\nIn a service network, the nodes are placed in a tree structure with a logical relationship of parent-child, like for example in a FTTH architecture in which a FCP is logically connected to a CO (see in particular Appendix 1: Setics Sttar Data Model for more details).\nThe assignment of unique identifiers to network nodes reflects this property by making sure to create each node identifier by concatenating the identifier of its parent node with the identifier of the node concerned.\n*Example\nWith the default naming given by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t.\n- CO identified by \u201cN001\u201d.\n- FCP identified by \u201cN001.02\u201d where \u201cN001\u201d is the identifier of the parent CO and \u201c.02\u201d is the identifier of the FCP within the service area of the parent CO.\nIn addition, in order to allow the import and reuse in a new project (or in a new iteration of an existing project) of identifiers already assigned to the nodes of the network, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will ignore the possible repetitions of identifiers.\n*Example\nIn Project 1, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t created a CO (Level 1) with the identifier \u201cN001\u201d and an FCP (Level 2) with the identifier \u201cN001.02\u201d.\nIn Project 2:\n- The previous CO and FCP layers are re-imported as input data at their respective levels, with the ELEMENTID attribute containing the identifiers previously assigned by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t as external identifier;\n- The node naming format is defined as {external-id } for Level 1 (CO) nodes as well as for Level 2 (FCP) nodes.\nIn Project 2, Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t will reuse the imposed COs and FCPs and retain their identifiers:\n- It will not create an identifier \u201cN001N001.02\u201d for the FCP as it would impose the concatenation of the identifier of the parent node with the node concerned (here the FCP \u201cN001.02\u201d with its parent the CO \u201cN001\u201d);\n- It will name the CO \u201cN001\u201d and the FCP \u201cN001.02\u201d based on intuition, without compromising the rule to bring up the hierarchy of nodes in their naming.",

The ending is just the part which is assign to the level of the node.\n\n pathway-id\n The identifier of the pathway used by the item.\n\n pathway-name\n The name of the pathway used by the item.\n\n pathway-external-id\n The external identifier of the pathway used by the item.\n\n closure-id\n The identifier previously assigned by Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t to the closure on the upstream junction of the cable item.\n\n closure-name\n The name of the closure on the upstream junction of the cable item.\n\n closure-external-id\n The external identifier of the closure on the upstream junction of the cable item.\n\n pas-id\n The identifier of the pathway access structure which link the item to the upstream network.\n\n destination-node-id\n The identifier of the node or the endpoint downstream of the item. (The item needs to be a cable.)\n\n destination-node-name\n The name of the node or the endpoint downstream of the item. (The item needs to be a cable.)\n\n destination-node-short-id\n The ending of the identifier of the node or the endpoint downstream of the item. The ending is just the part which is assign to the level of the node. (The item needs to be a cable.)\n\n origin-pas-id\n The identifier of the pathway access structure which link the item to the upstream network. (The item needs to be a cable.)\n\n destination-pas-id\n The identifier of the pathway access structure which link the item to the downstream network.

(The item needs to be a cable.)\n\n tube-count\n The number of tubes in the item. (The item needs to be a duct.)\n\n*The symbols \u201c{\u201d and \u201c}\u201d and the characters included between them are interpreted as variable definitions used to customize the naming. An unsupported variable name will simply be ignored.\nIn addition, to get a character \u201c{\u201d or \u201c}\u201d in the name of an identifier without Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t interpreting it as a variable definition, it is necessary to use \u201c{{\u201d and \u201c}}\u201d instead.\n*Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t guarantees the creation of unique identifiers even if the custom naming format would not create this uniqueness. In this case: Setics Sttar Advanced Designer\t adds a single numeric value to suffix each item in question.",
